# Coding Challenge

## Tasks
For this year, ISC21 SCC, we will have a coding challenge.
The main target is to analyze MPI_alltoallv patterns within the application. This challenge will be smaller tasks.

 

MPI_alltoallv is a an MPI function call in which each rank sends to each other rank up to one message, similar to alltoall, but the size of each message could be different. More info about MPI_alltoallv can be found [here](https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v4.1/man3/MPI_Alltoallv.3.php).
### Task 1: Understanding MPI alltov calls
